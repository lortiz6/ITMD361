<h1>Hello world, welcome to my first website!</h1>
<h2>Liliana Ortiz</h2>
<h3>Lab 1</h3>
  <p>I finished my Associates in computer Science at Wilbur Wright College, and now I am a third year student in IIT pursing a Bachelors in Information Technology and Management</p>
  <p>I enjoy swiming, play basketball, help others, and love my family.</p>
  <p>Fun fact: I am allergic to dogs and cats, but I own a dog. My dog's name is Mimi and would not change her for nothing.</p>
